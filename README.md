# ESP32-007-Gesture-Counter-with-ESP32
This project is a gesture-based counter using an ESP32, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor, and an OLED Display. Each time a gesture (hand movement within range) is detected, the ESP32 increments a counter and displays the value on the OLED.  A fun and interactive project that combines distance sensing with real-time counting!
